    <h1>Discover Nepal through refreshing tropical and subtropical forests in the lap of Himalayas.</h1>
    
    <p>Trek through refreshing lush green tropical and subtropical forests to reach remote regions under arctic conditions in the lap of the Himalayas. Nepal is blessed with diverse landscape where within a distance of a 
    hundred kilometers you can travel from the sweltering jungles of the tarai plains of the south to freezing temperatures in the Himalayan region in the north.</p>
   <p>The jungles in the southern parts of Nepal are only a half-hour to an hour's flight away. The Chitwan National Park, Bardiya National Park, Parsa Wildlife Reserve and Shuklaphanta National Park are home to incredible varieties 
    of mammals, reptiles and birds.</p>
    
    <h2> List of National Parks in Nepal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chitwan National Park</li>
        <li>Khaptad National Park</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Chitwan National Park</h2>
   <p>Chitwan National Park is recognized as the best conservation area in all of Asia with a fascinating range of wildlife roaming free in its jungles and grasslands. With their natural habitat well preserved, animals are thriving. Among 
    these are the endangered species: the most sought after, Royal Bengal tiger and the Greater one-horned rhinoceros.</p>
    <h2>Khaptad National Park</h2>
    <p>Khaptad National Park in the far west has a whole new topography with rolling hills amidst vast expanse of green pastures. Visit Sagarmatha National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, Langtang National Park, Makalu Barun National Park, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, Rara National Park, and Shey Phoksundo National Park, some of the world's most fascinating trekking regions besides being the highest in altitude. Crossing 5000m passes are just part of your trekking itinerary and not a mountain climb. Hike 
    up from lush green pastures to arid ice and snow covered base camps while enjoying spectacular mountain views along the way.</p>

    <h1>Geographical Features of national Park</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A national park is a generally large area of scenic beauty that the government protects and maintains to conserve the local flora and fauna, landscapes, historic treasures, and points of scientific importance.</li>
        <li>National parks offer people relaxation and pleasure.</li>
        <li>People are permitted to access national parks to see wild creatures ranging freely in their native habitats and historic items of the region set aside for leisure, enjoyment, inspiration, and education.</li>
        <li>A national park is a space set aside for the preservation of species, whereby public entertainment is allowed as long as it supports the conservation effort’s main goal.</li>
        <li>To conserve their natural beauty, national parks are shielded from the majority of development plans.</li>
        <li>Inside a national park, human activities like mining, hunting, and fishing are prohibited.</li>

    <h1>Biodiversity of National Park</h1>
    <b>Discovery matters</b>
       
        <p>What connects national parks, biodiversity, and relevance? The public perception of the centenary National Park 
        Service is increasingly focused on the nation’s biodiversity, though this vocabulary is not yet universally practiced. 
        Technically, biodiversity is the diversity of life across the ecosystem, species, and genetic levels. Personally, only the 
        most inattentive of park visitors do not find themselves taking a short breath in wonder and delight when first encountering 
        a park’s diversity of life: majestic trees, expansive prairie, tender wildflowers, teeming wild fish, charismatic wild predators 
        and prey, a hatch of the salmon fly, marine mammals, migratory birds and butterflies on their long journeys, cold-blooded amphibians
        and reptiles, coral reefs, and the colorful extremophiles of acidic hot springs. The diversity of life lives on in its full exuberance, 
        we intend and hope.
        </p>
      
    <b>Words Matter</b>
        <p>Let’s take a step back from the edge of the profound, draw a short breath, and think about our current state of affairs. Just as of old, 
        we continue to record and pass along our rules, accomplishments, aspirations, and paths through written narrative. In the past three decades,
        the scientific and nonscientific narrative about our growing understanding and anxiety about the eco logical consequences of the accelerating 
        loss of biodiversity, especially at the species level, has exploded globally. From this emerging understanding of the ecological centrality of 
        biodiversity in the human condition, this discussion has expanded to include the aesthetic, ethical, sociological, and economic consequences of 
        the loss of diversity of life. Distinctly, Nobel Peace Prize–winner Eric Chivian and colleague Aaron Bernstein (2008) undertook the first in-depth 
        synthesis of the fundamental and profound relationships between biodiversity and human health. Though we face many challenges to improving the human 
        condition, conservation of the diversity of life remains within our collective capacity. Conceivable.</p>

    <h1>Cultural Significance of national park</h1>
        <p>National parks often have cultural and historical significance, preserving the heritage of indigenous peoples or early settlers. These cultural elements, 
        such as ancient ruins, are vital to understanding our history and heritage. National parks protect and celebrate cultural history. They protect wildlife and 
        their habitats from human impact and destruction. They provide animals a safe space to survive and reproduce. They protect places of natural beauty and are home
        to several endemic species.</p>
